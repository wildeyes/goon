# clone-api
If you're working with a client that doesn't use staging and the API you depend on keeps crashing, or working from a flaky internet connection or none at all, this tool is for you.

Specify a list of endpoints for CloneAPI, and it will cache them for you and put up an http server for you to use, so you won't be reliant on flaky APIs.
